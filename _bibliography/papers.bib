  abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized neuroimaging studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders. The difference between brain age and chronological age is a useful biomarker for identifying neurological disorders. Furthermore, delineating both age and gender is important for the study of illnesses exhibiting the phenotypic difference in these. In this paper, we focus on the prediction of age and gender from brain connectomes data which is a step further to full automation of disease prediction. We model the connectomes as brain graphs. Data is collected as functional MRI (fMRI) signals and the graphs are created by binarizing the correlation among the fMRI signals at the brain parcels considered as nodes. Such a graph represents the neurobiological functional connectivity. We further differentiate between static and dynamic connectivity. The former is constructed with the correlation of the overall signal at the nodes, while the latter is modeled as a sequence of brain graphs constructed over sequential time periods. Our hypothesis is that leveraging information from both the static and dynamic functional connectivity is beneficial to the task at hand. Our main contribution lies in our proposed novel input data representation and proposed recurrent graph-based deep learning model setting together. The proposed Dynamic Graph-based Gated Recurrent Unit (DG-GRU) comprises a mechanism to process both types of connectivities. In addition, it can be easily incorporated into any deep neural model. We show a thorough analysis of the model on two publicly available datasets HCP and ABIDE for two tasks to show the superiority of the model.},

  title={Generalized Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Numerically Solved Transient Physical Systems},
  author={Kondamadugula, Leela Sai Prabhat Reddy and Meethal, Rishith Ellath},
  abstract={We introduce a generalized physics-informed machine learning workflow to accurately predict the behavior of a transient physical system with enhanced physics conformity. A
                                        physics-guided machine learning (PGML) model is developed to achieve this goal. Our model consists of two main
                                        parts for a given transient system: (1) a physics-based numerical model which solves the system using conventional numerical methods and returns the stiffness matrix and force vector
                                        at each time step; (2) a neural network (NN) based machine
                                        learning (ML) surrogate model which predicts the solution
                                        of the system using a custom physics-guided loss function
                                        constructed from system matrix and force vector. The proposed workflow results in a physics-aware Machine Learning (ML) model. Such a trained model can be used to avoid
                                        the prohibitively expensive step of running a transient system
                                        simulation at the desired resolutions in space and time. We
                                        demonstrate and test the model on single-degree-of-freedom
                                        (SDOF) and multiple-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) system's
                                        examples from structural dynamics. Our results show that the
                                        method predicts the simulation results accurately. The proposed workflow can be directly adapted to any other physics
                                        and numerical method as it is not tailored towards a specific
                                        physics or a numerical method.},
