> _It is true what they say - it's not we who control the money, it's the money that controls us._

A short book which packs a punch way above its weight.
Life is a ride at best and at worst. It is a ride that gives you joy as much as it gives you sorrow.
It teaches you as much as it can, even if you donâ€™t want to learn.

And money, money is the perhaps the boon and bane of life.
Ghachar Ghochar reiterates these simple truths within its pages, in a story that it is as thrilling as it is appealing.
