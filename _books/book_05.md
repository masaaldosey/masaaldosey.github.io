> _The death sentence and the life sentence are equally immoral, but if 
I had to choose between the death penalty and imprisonment for life, 
I would certainly choose the second. To live anyhow is better than not at all._

A short story indeed to make you wonder on the philosophy of life.
Took me 15 minutes to read this, and I might have cried.
There are a few paragraphs at the end that explain exactly how I feel about books and life.

How absurd that I discovered the writings of Anton Chekhov!! I LOVE CHEKHOV ALREADY.
