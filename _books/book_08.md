> _No matter what their delusions are, parents do not really know their children._

This is my first time reading Manu Joseph's work.
It is a story about a father, Oseup Chacko, who tries to find a good reason to believe
that his son Unni's suicide had an honorable motive. Coping with his wife
Mariamma's psychological problems at the same time.

This book broke me. What an idiot you turned out to be Unni Chacko. Read it
at your own risk.
