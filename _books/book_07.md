> _Have faith in yourself, but also have faith in faith.
Not faith as others define it. Faith as you define it.
Faith as faith defines itself in your heart._

COULD NOT PUT THIS ONE DOWN. Finished it in one sitting.
I generally do not read memoirs. But I love this one Phil Knight.

A story of an empire which was built from a $50 loan from the
author's father. A memoir full of grit, passion, and drama.
