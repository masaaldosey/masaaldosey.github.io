You know, man, it doesn't matter who translates you.
You always sound just like yourself. A casual observer.
And yet the casualness reveals so much about us.

Chekhov represents things as they are; sometimes good, sometimes bad, yet
full of hope beyond all the setbacks and pitfalls which life has to throw
at you. His stories are about living, about love for people.
