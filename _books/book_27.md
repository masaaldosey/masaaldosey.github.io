> _Grief is a cruel kind of education. You learn
how ungentle mourning can be, how full of anger.
You learn how glib condolences can feel. You learn
how much grief is about language, the failure of
language and the grasping for language._

THIS BOOK IS CLOSE TO ME !! BEAUTIFUL WRITING !! :black_heart: :black_heart:
