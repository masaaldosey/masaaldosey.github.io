> _For those with other entitlements, especially the urban rich,
casting their vote may mean nothing. (I for one have never voted
despite trying to do all my work within the frame of law and
democracy.) But to the village poor, it is a sign of one’s worth.
‘Am I a corpse that I cannot vote,’ was the unfailingly constant
answer when I asked people why they voted when all it brought them

This is not a happy or light read. Dealing with a sensitive social issue,
it is harsh but rooted in reality. It remains unfortunate that even in
today’s world, there are instances of unfiltered hatred, discrimination
and violence based on the age-old caste system and family 'status'.
Thank you but no thank you Perumal Murugan. :sob:
