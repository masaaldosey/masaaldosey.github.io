> _But is it not already an insult to call chess anything so
narrow as a game? Is it not also a science, an art, a unique
yoking of opposites, ancient and yet eternally new, mechanically
constituted and yet an activity of the imagination alone, limited
to a fixed geometric area but unlimited in its permutations,
constantly evolving and yet sterile, a cogitation producing nothing,
a mathematics calculating nothing, an art without an artwork, an
architecture without substance, the only game that belongs to all
peoples and all eras, while no one knows what god put it on earth to
deaden boredom, sharpen the mind, and fortify the spirit? Where does
it begin, where does it end?_

Slim and unforgettable read. Stefan outlines a profound psychological theory:
that a human beingâ€™s greatest resource - the ability to reflect upon himself and
his actions - is also his greatest vulnerability.
