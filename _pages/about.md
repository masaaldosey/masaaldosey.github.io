Hi! I am a software developer located in Munich. Prior to this, I completed my masters in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/in/fuer-studieninteressierte/master-studiengaenge/computational-science-and-engineering/){:target="\_blank"} at [The Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm originally from India and living in Munich since 2018.
When I am not creating bugs, I like to play almost any sport, watch [movies](https://letterboxd.com/masaaldosey/){:target="\_blank"}
and [read](https://www.notion.so/leelasaiprabhat/6009deb485244a26920bdd3b2f1842b6?v=0daabeb705d74f50ab03928105c18970){:target="\_blank"}.
