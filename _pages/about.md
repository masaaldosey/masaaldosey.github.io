Currently, I work as a software developer at [Agile Robots AG](https://www.agile-robots.com/){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to this, I completed my masters in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/in/fuer-studieninteressierte/master-studiengaenge/computational-science-and-engineering/){:target="\_blank"} at [The Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/){:target="\_blank"}.

I did my master thesis at the Chair for [Computer Aided Medical Procedures](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/){:target="\_blank"} (CAMP). I was guided by under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Nassir Navab](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/cv-nassir-navab/nassir-navab/){:target="\_blank"} and [Dr. Anees Kazi](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/members/senior-research-scientists/anees-kazi/){:target="\_blank"}. My research tackled the [Cross-modal Retrieval](https://paperswithcode.com/task/cross-modal-retrieval/codeless?page=6){:target="\_blank"} problem with the help of [Graph Neural Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network){:target="\_blank"}.

When I am not working, I like to play almost any sport, read, watch movies and play video games. I also have a keen interest in Personal Finance.
