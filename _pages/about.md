Hi! I am a software developer located in Munich. Prior to this, I completed my masters in [Computational Science and Engineering](https://www.in.tum.de/in/fuer-studieninteressierte/master-studiengaenge/computational-science-and-engineering/){:target="\_blank"} at [The Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/){:target="\_blank"}.

I come from India and have been living in Munich since 2018.

I love to spend time with my wife :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:. If there is time left, I try to play almost any sport, watch [movies](https://letterboxd.com/masaaldosey/){:target="\_blank"}
and [read](/books/).
