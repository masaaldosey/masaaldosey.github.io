This is my personal homepage.</p><p>I like to work at the intersection of hardware and software. Today, I am located in Munich and work full time as a <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhat-reddy/>Software Developer</a>. I spend my day-to-day on making progress feel human.
Whether it is through technology, collaboration or small everyday actions. I want to help
people grow and create things that make life a little fairer, kinder and, more connected.</p><p>Apart from work, I really enjoy spending time with my wife Preethika, my bilogical sister Meghu (Meghana), our families and,
friends. I love working out, reading, cooking and, enjoy all genres of music.</p><p><figure><img src=/static/images/2025-with-wife.jpeg alt="With Preethika"><figcaption>With Preethika (Venice, 2025)</figcaption></figure></p><p>In school, I was an average student academically. I was happy with it and spent time on trying to know
things which aren&rsquo;t generally taught at school. My dad (Prasad), often used to talk about <em>personal
finance</em> during my formative years. This sparked an interest about the topic within me which, I am enthusiastic (apart from
<a href=https://landonorris.com/>Lando Norris</a>) about even now.</p><p>Post my Bachelors in India, I came to Germany for my Masters at the <a href=https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/computational-science-and-engineering-cse-master-of-science-msc>Technical University of Munich</a>. I feel that my time in Munich was crucial in shaping who I am today as a person.</p><p>This website is a collection of notes, the insights that I&rsquo;ve gained across various fields of life, and I want to share,
especially for those navigating life and have a childlike wonder about everyday things of life.</p><hr><p>Get in touch via <a href=mailto:prabhatreddyk@gmail.com>Email</a> or <a href=https://twitter.com/masaaldosey>Twitter</a>.</p></div><div class=tags></div></div></div></div></section><footer class=footer>Leela Kondamadugula &copy; 2026</footer></body></html>
