I am Leela, and I **love** developing good software which solves problems. This is my personal homepage.

I like to work at the intersection of hardware and software. Today, I am located in Munich and work full time as a [Software Developer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prabhat-reddy/). I spend my day-to-day on making progress feel human.
Whether it is through technology, collaboration or small everyday actions. I want to help
people grow and create things that make life a little fairer, kinder and, more connected.

Apart from work, I really enjoy spending time with my wife [Preethika](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naga-preethika-mule-912bb617a/), my bilogical sister Meghu (Meghana), our families and, friends. I love working out, [reading](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/148634318-leela-kondamadugula?ref=nav_mybooks&shelf=read), cooking and, enjoy all genres of music.

In school, I was an average student academically. I was happy with it and spent time on trying to know
things which aren't generally taught at school. My dad (Prasad), often used to talk about *personal
finance* during my formative years. This sparked an interest about the topic within me.

Post my Bachelors in India, I came to Germany for my Masters at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/studies/degree-programs/detail/computational-science-and-engineering-cse-master-of-science-msc). I feel that my time in Munich was crucial in shaping who I am today as a person. 


This website is a collection of notes, the insights that I've gained across various fields of life, and I want to share,
especially for those navigating life and have a childlike wonder about everyday things of life.
